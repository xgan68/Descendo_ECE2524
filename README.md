Summary of the Project: Descendo is a text-based advantage game where you can create you own charater with 6 different classes, and experience the mystical world. Although it is a text based advantage game, we added excited battle animations for the battle scene.

Description of the Project: We categorize functions in different head files. The program is very modularized, we miniumize the affect to all functions from change one function. Thus it will make future revising easier. The functions are named as their job, which will help other programmer understand this project more quickly.
